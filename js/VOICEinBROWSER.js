//What about more complicated commands?
//annyang understands commands with named variables, splats, and optional words.
//Use named variables for one word arguments in your command.
//Use splats to capture multi-word text at the end of your command (greedy).
//Use optional words or phrases to define a part of the command as optional.

<script>
var commands = {
  // annyang will capture anything after a splat (*) and pass it to the function.
  // e.g. saying "Show me Batman and Robin" is the same as calling showFlickr('Batman and Robin');
  'show me *tag': showFlickr,

  // A named variable is a one word variable, that can fit anywhere in your command.
  // e.g. saying "calculate October stats" will call calculateStats('October');
  'calculate :month stats': calculateStats,

  // By defining a part of the following command as optional, annyang will respond to both:
  // "say hello to my little friend" as well as "say hello friend"
  'say hello (to my little) friend': greeting
