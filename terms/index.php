<h3>Article 4. Terms of Use - Service</h3>
    <p>It is up to the User to decide what information will be saved and/or exchanged using the Service. Trendy Publishing has no knowledge of that information. As such, the User bears responsibility for ensuring that that information is lawful and does not infringe upon any third-party rights.

None of the situations outlined above will result in any liability to pay damages.</p>

<h3>Article 8. Amendment of the Terms and Conditions</h3>
    <p>Trendy Publishing reserves the right to amend or expand these Terms and Conditions.
    Amendments will also apply to Agreements concluded previously, with due observance of a period of 30 days after the amendments are announced on the Website or by electronic notification. Minor amendments may be implemented at any time.
    If the User does not wish to accept an amendment to these Terms and Conditions, he or she may, until the date on which the new Terms and Conditions enter into force, dissolve the Agreement with effect from that date or with effect from the date on which the notice of termination is received if that date is later than that on which the amendment takes effect.</p>
